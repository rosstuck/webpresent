# Webpresent.js
The webpresent slide template can be used to make dynamic or interactive presentations using HTML. As with any HTML/CSS
page you can style the slides yourself using the (S)CSS file.

## Usage
Use the arrow keys (left & right) to navigate.
Also, this works with a wireless presenter tool (which uses page-up and page-down internally).

## Features
Different type of transitions:
- Fade in (default)
- Fade in from the left
- Fade in from the right
- Fade in from the bottom
- Fade in from the top
- No transition at all

## Known issues
This presentation template was made for use with Chrome. I've tried to make it as cross-browser compatible as possible
with least effort, so it still includes some small bugs.

- In Firefox when pressing the right-arrow key, the page seems to move to the right
- Transitions don't work in IE (requires fix in js)
- Some transitions aren't working properly in Firefox

## Wanted features
- Interface so users can navigate after you've uploaded the slides
